0.  Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a long word said to be the 
    disease from inhaling volcanic dusts.

1.  getrusage shows the resources used by a program

2.  There are 17 members to the struct rusage

3.  Because getrusage returns a struct with all the members in it.  We would have to pull out the information 
    from the struct into a new variable to pass that otherwise we would be forced to copy all the variable members
    to pass it on.

4.  Speller reads in the first character of the text file.  It will stop if it runs into the end of the file.  
    If it reads a letter or apostrophe it will append it to the word string.  If it finds a string that is longer
    than 46 characters it determines it is not a word and just pulls out the rest of the string and resets its index 
    to 0.  If it finds a number it just pulls out the rest of the string and resets the index to 0.  If it comes to 
    the end of a word and the index is greater than 0, it terminates the string and updates the word counter.  If it 
    finds the word is misspelled it prints it out and updates the misspelled words counter.

5.  fscanf would not be as successful because as it read out the string it wouldn't be able to isolate the 
    numbers that occur or non apostophe punctuation.

6.  Check and load parameters are constant because the the values word and dictionary are constants in the speller file.
